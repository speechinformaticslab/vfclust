#can install development version locally by typing
python setup.py develop
#This doesn't install in default installation directory, but tells python to look
#in the git folder for the source instead.

#Make sure README doesn't have syntax errors
python setup.py check

#what to include:
MANIFEST.in has to have everything you want in the .tar.gz source distribution
anything you want installed in site-packages has to be listed in the package_data in setup

#default pip installation directory
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/

#To generate documentation:
1. run sphinx-autodoc
    - root path "docs"
    - autodoc "y"
2. cd docs
3. sphinx-apidoc -o . ../vfclust/  #put docs here, source is /vfclust/ module
4. edit index.rst to have ".. include:: ../README.rst" just before "Contents"
5. edit conf.py copyright to be Serguei
6. run "make html" to generate the html docs.
Optional:
add the following to conf.py:
    autodoc_default_flags = ["members", "inherited-members", "show-inheritance"]
    autodoc_member_order = "bysource"
    autoclass_content = "both"
    html_theme = 'nature'

#create source code distribution (this is uploaded to pip) and put it in the dist directory
python setup.py sdist

#To test pip installation
https://wiki.python.org/moin/TestPyPI
upload -
#if not registered
python setup.py register -r https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
#then upload
#python setup.py sdist upload -r https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
python setup.py sdist
twine upload -r test dist/VFClust-0.1.4.1.tar.gz #or whatever the current version is
#install -
#from virtualenv - source bin/activate
pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi vfclust --upgrade

#to convert to markdown
import pypandoc
z = pypandoc.convert('README','markdown',format='rst')
with open('README.md','w') as outfile:
outfile.write(z)
